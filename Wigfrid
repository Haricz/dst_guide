		You might have collected a lot in the previous days, so if you have extra resources and finish fast,
		explore more of the world.


	* you only need (48) logs for crafting everything, but gather more for the campfire's fuel needz
	* you can explore by day and only start crafting during the night
	* crafting at night would be a good idea 'cuz it gives you sanity points to counter the night's sanity drain
